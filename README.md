What is one thing JavaScript can do that HTML/CSS cannot?
JavaScript can add interactivity and logic to a webpage.
Unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript can respond to user actions (clicks, input, events), perform calculations, manipulate data, validate forms, and dynamically update the DOM without reloading the page.

Why do we prefer const by default?
We prefer const because it prevents accidental reassignment.
Using const makes code safer, more predictable, and easier to debug.
If a variable should not change, declaring it as const enforces that rule at the language level.

What is the difference between == and ===?
== compares values but performs type coercion (automatic type conversion).
=== compares both value and type strictly.

What was the most useful Console command today (and why)?
console.table() was especially useful because it displays arrays of objects in a structured table format, making it easier to inspect data clearly and debug complex objects compared to normal console logs.

CSS hover vs JavaScript hover: which felt more robust and why?
CSS hover felt more robust and efficient for simple visual effects.
It is declarative, cleaner, and requires less code. JavaScript hover is useful for complex logic-based interactions, but for styling and animations, CSS is simpler and better practice.
